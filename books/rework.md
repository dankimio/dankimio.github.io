## Chapter 2 - Takedowns

- Even worse, they want to drag others down into their tomb. If you’re hopeful and ambitious, they’ll try to convince you your ideas are impossible. They’ll say you’re wasting your time. Don’t believe them. That world may be real for them, but it doesn’t mean you have to live in it.
- You have the most information when you’re doing something, not before you’ve done it.

## Chapter 3 - Go

- Then they protect their ego with the excuse of time.
- Besides, the perfect time never arrives. You’re always too young or old or busy or broke or something else.
- When you don’t know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious.

## Chapter 4 - Progress

- Once your product does what it needs to do, get it out there.
- Start at the epicenter.
- Besides, you often can’t recognize the details that matter most until after you start building.
- Decisions are progress. Each one you make is a brick in your foundation. You can’t build on top of “We’ll decide later,” but you can build on top of “Done.”
- Long projects zap morale. The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch.
- The core of your business should be built around things that won’t change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now.
- People use equipment as a crutch.
- If you’ve got nothing to say … well, you’ve got nothing to say..

## Chapter 5 - Productivity

- Reports no one reads, diagrams no one looks at, and specs that never resemble the finished product. These things take forever to make but only seconds to forget.
- The problem with abstractions (like reports and documents) is that they create illusions of agreement. A hundred people can read the same words, but in their heads, they’re imagining a hundred different things.
- During alone time, give up instant messages, phone calls, e-mail, and meetings. Just shut up and get to work. You’ll be surprised how much more you get done.
- They often include at least one moron who inevitably gets his turn to waste everyone’s time with nonsense.
- Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. Judo solutions are all about getting the most out of doing the least.
- The solution: Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You’re probably still going to get it wrong, but you’ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.
- Instead, prioritize visually. Put the most important thing at the top.
- These small decisions mean you can afford to change. There’s no big penalty if you mess up. You just fix it.

## Chapter 6 - Competitors

- What’s going on in here is way more important than what’s going on out there. When you spend time worrying about someone else, you can’t spend that time improving yourself.

## Chapter 7 - Evolution

- You rarely regret saying no. But you often wind up regretting saying yes.
- And there are always more people who are not using your product than people who are.

## Chapter 8 - Promotion

- So why do you know these few better than others? Because they share everything they know. They put their recipes in cookbooks and show their techniques on cooking shows. As a business owner, you should share everything you know too.

## Chapter 9 - Hiring

- Plus, you should want to be intimately involved in all aspects of your business. Otherwise you’ll wind up in the dark, putting your fate solely in the hands of others. That’s dangerous.
- I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.
- Too much time in academia can actually do you harm. Take writing, for example. When you get out of school, you have to unlearn so much of the way they teach you to write there. Some of the misguided lessons you learn in academia.
- That means you need to avoid hiring delegators, those people who love telling others what to do. Delegators are dead weight for a small team.
- Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand.

## Chapter 10 - Damage Control

- A good apology accepts responsibility.

## Chapter 11 - Culture

- Culture is action, not words.
- “If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know.” You want busy people. People who have a life outside of work. People who care about more than one thing.
- They think sounding big makes them appear bigger and more “professional.” But it really just makes them sound ridiculous.
- Easy. Easy is a word that’s used to describe other people’s jobs. “That should be easy for you to do, right?” But notice how rarely people describe their own tasks as easy.
- So reserve your use of emergency language for true emergencies.

## Conclusion

- Inspiration is perishable We all have ideas. Ideas are immortal. They last forever. What doesn’t last forever is inspiration. Inspiration is like fresh fruit or milk: It has an expiration date. If you want to do something, you’ve got to do it now.
